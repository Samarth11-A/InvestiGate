        1. **Indicators** (0-100 scale):
           - growth: Based on traction metrics, revenue growth, user growth, market position
           - team: Based on founder experience, team composition, domain expertise
           - market: Based on market size (TAM/SAM/SOM), growth trajectory, competitive landscape
           - product: Based on product-market fit indicators, differentiation, technological moats

        2. **Overall Outlook**:
           - overall: "Strong", "Moderate", or "Weak"
           - summary: 2-3 sentence investment thesis
           - keyPoints: 5-7 key actionable insights for investment decision

        Guidelines for scoring:
        - Growth (0-100): Consider revenue trajectory, user growth, market penetration, milestones achieved
        - Team (0-100): Evaluate founder track record, technical expertise, domain knowledge, team completeness
        - Market (0-100): Assess market size, growth rate, competitive positioning, market timing
        - Product (0-100): Analyze product-market fit, differentiation, barriers to entry, technological advantage

        Guidelines for outlook:
        - "Strong": High confidence in success, multiple positive indicators, clear path to scale
        - "Moderate": Mixed signals, some concerns but overall positive, requires monitoring
        - "Weak": Significant concerns, high risks, limited upside potential

        Ensure keyPoints are actionable and specific to this company's situation.
